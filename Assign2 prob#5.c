//a)
//For w's condition it only inlcludes OR operation , in which any value that would be used is output as 1 , True.
//For x, AND operator shows that all values have to be used and as j=-1, the value would be negative. Hence,
//negative represents 0 so output is 0.
//As AND is listened first than OR, so as k = 0, value returened would be 0, 
//Due to OR it becomes 1 : 0 and the value for y is becomes 1.
//For z , it reads the AND operator first and even if its 0, the OR operator would return 1 so z becomes 1

//b)
// k = 2 / 3 = 0 , 0 x 3 would give 0 as output
// l = 3 / 2 = 1.5 so here the returened value is 1. So 1*2= 2, hence 2 is output
// 2 / 3 = 0.000, 0.000 x 3 = 0.000, hence 0.000 output
// 3 / 2 would return 1 as its value as its declared as an integer, multiplied by 2 later giving 2.00000 as output.

// c)
//returns 0 as the equation format of n is for float although it is declared as an integer.
// output shows a=m and b=n
